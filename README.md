# Perform-EDA-on-a-titanic-dataset
This micro project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in the Spyder IDE. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived, their age, gender, class, and fare paid.

The analysis is conducted using three CSV files:

train.csv – contains the main dataset used for EDA, with labels (Survived or not).

test.csv – contains similar data without survival labels.

gender_submission.csv – includes predicted survival outcomes for test data (optional use for merging).
